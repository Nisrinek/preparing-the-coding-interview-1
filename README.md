# preparing-the-coding-interview
This repository goal is to help you find good ressources in order to prepare better for your next coding interview ,in fact i've spent the last few months collecting this ressources while personnaly preparing for my interview,wish it will helpful for you.
i'll try to update it each time i find new interesting stuffs :).


The first thing i recommend is to start preparing on a whiteboard ,The biggest problem a lot of candidate are  facing is that they are not feeling comfortable with the whiteboard coding .secondly,practise while expressing your ideas loud ,it's better to practise with a friend in order to ask them for feedback .There's a nice video posted by Google which shows an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&t=700s">example of the coding interview</a>
so now let's start talking about the ressources:
